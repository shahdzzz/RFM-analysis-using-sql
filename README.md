# RFM Analysis of Customer Data using SQL

![RFM Analysis](images/rfm_analysis.png)

Welcome to the RFM Analysis of Customer Data project! This project aims to demonstrate how to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using SQL on customer data. RFM analysis is a valuable technique in marketing and customer segmentation, helping businesses better understand and segment their customer base for targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

RFM analysis is a method to identify and categorize customers based on their buying behavior. It considers three primary factors:

1. Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
2. Frequency (F): How often a customer makes purchases.
3. Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends on purchases.

By segmenting customers into various RFM groups, businesses can tailor marketing strategies to target these different segments effectively.

## Prerequisites

To run the SQL queries in this project, you'll need:

- A relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
- Access to a database containing customer transaction data.
## SQL Queries

The SQL queries for RFM analysis are typically used to calculate the recency, frequency, and monetary values for each customer. You can find example SQL queries for each component in the [sql_queries.sql](sql_queries.sql) file.

To perform RFM analysis, you'll need to:

1. Calculate the recency of each customer's last purchase.
2. Calculate the frequency by counting the number of purchases made by each customer.
3. Calculate the monetary value by summing up the purchase amounts for each customer.

## Results and Interpretation

After running the RFM SQL queries on your customer data, you'll obtain the RFM values for each customer. These values can then be used to segment customers into different groups based on their buying behavior. For example:

- High-RF: High recency, high frequency, and high monetary value. These are the most valuable customers who have made recent, frequent, and high-value purchases.
- Low-RF: Low recency, low frequency, and low monetary value. These customers haven't made purchases recently, often, or spent much.

You can customize the segmentation criteria based on your business goals and customer behaviour.

## Conclusion

RFM analysis is a powerful technique for understanding customer behaviour and optimizing marketing efforts. By leveraging SQL to perform RFM analysis on your customer data, you can gain insights into customer segments and tailor your marketing strategies accordingly.
